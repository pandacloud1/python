## SETS
- They are unordered list of unique items
- They do not follow any order, hence you cannot print index of sets
- You can use set methods like add, remove, discard & pop
- Additionally, you can also use union, intersection & difference

### Set of fruits
```py
fruits = {"banana", "apple", "guava"}
print(fruits)
print(fruits[0])     # this is not possible
```
