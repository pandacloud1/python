## TUPLES
- Tuples are same as list
- But they cannot be altered (immutable)
- They are written inside round braces()
- You can add a single entry in list, but in tuples you need to add additional comma [eg. name = ("Panda",)]

### Tuple example
```py
tup = ("Panda", "Cloud", "Academy")
print(tup)

# Tuples are immutable
tup[2] = "Institute"
print(tup)
```
